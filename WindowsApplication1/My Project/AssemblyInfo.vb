<Assembly: AssemblyDescription("The goal of ASAS (Analysis and Simulation of Atomic Spectra) software is to facilitate the planning and data analysis of atomic spectroscopy experiments particularly that in the field of atomic photoionization by multiphoton or multi-step process. Furthermore, the ASAS allows users to build their own database according to their research field. The ASAS software was developed in Visual Basic using Visual Studio editor Microsoft Express 2010. The program permits interactivity between the output data obtained through their routines and all graphs are constructed from the GNUPLOT graphing program.")>
